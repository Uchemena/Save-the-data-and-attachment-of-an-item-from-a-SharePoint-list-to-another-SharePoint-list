<p>If you're working on a solution to save an attachment file from one SharePoint List to another, or need to save the data and attachment of an item from a SharePoint list to a different SharePoint list, check out this blog post </p>.

<br>

This can work when an item is created in SharePoint list A and you want the data and attachment created to be saved in another SharePoint list when a condition is met. 



# # Use Case: Bank Customer Complaint Management
To illustrate the process, consider this example scenario:

Bank ABC operates a Customer Complaint Management System with various teams handling different categories of customer complaints.

They utilize a SharePoint list named 'Customer Complaints'. Whenever a new item is added to this list and the 'ATM card' is chosen from the 'Type of complaint' choice column, the system automatically stores the data and any attached files from the 'Customer Complaints' SharePoint list into the 'Customer Support Database' SharePoint list.



Disclaimer: This is not an actual bank, but a scenario I created.
